### Instructions to RUN:

1. Make sure epmd daemon is running. Run epmd -daemon
2. Run server first. Run following commands from the directory which has mix.exs

      **mix escript.build** 

      **./project x**

Here x can be any number from 1 to 63.

3. Run client after server got setup and started mining. Run following command

      **mix escript.build**
      
      **./project1 x.x.x.x**

Here in place of x.x.x.x insert the IP address of server.

To get results instantly i.e. within microseconds, we recommend to provide coins with less than 5 leading zeros.

If you give more than 6 leading zeros as input, you may have to wait for few minutes.

Instruction to Abort execution:
Press ‘ctrl +  C’ in server console as well in client console to abort the execution.

### Iterative technique to mine Bitcoin:

1. We have used actor model in the implementation to parallely mine the bitcoins. We have 3 modules

     i. Project1:       	Checks whether input is number or IP and delegates work to the Manager.

     ii. MiningManager:  If the input is number it spawns the workers and keep on printing results sent by the workers. If the input is IP address then it spawns the node and contacts the MiningManager of server. Based on the leading zeros replied by server, it starts mining. And when client's workers get the strings whose sha256 matches with the leading zeros, it sends the result to server.

   iii. Local Miner:         This has the core logic of mining. Each worker executes the logic present in this module. This increments a given string and encrypts the complete string using sha256 hashing. Then if the encrypted string has given leading zeros then it sends the result to MiningManager. If there is no match, then it again increments the string and keeps on validating the result.

2. Base 36 Encoding:      We have used Base36 binary to text encoding which represents the binary data in an ASCII format. So, when we say we increment the string, then the istring is encoded into Base36 and then its binary value is incremented and then we validate the corresponding ASCII value of new binary data. 

This is the main idea of our mining technique.

3. Workload:                   We have given work of 100 million iterations to each worker.

Real time = 1.033s CPU time = 3.245s
No of cores = CPU time / Real time = 3.245 / 1.033 = 3.14

This means that 4 cores has been used.


### Result for 5 leading zeros:

Real time = 2.702s CPU time = 9.675s
No of cores = CPU time / Real time = 9.675 / 2.702  = 3.58

This means that 4 cores has been used.
